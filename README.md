# Handwritten-Digits-Recoginition
Handwritten digit recognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network. It basically detects the scanned images of handwritten digits. We have taken this a step further where our handwritten digit recognition system not only detects scanned images of handwritten digits but also allows writing digits on the screen with the help of an integrated GUI for recognition.

# Problem Statement
Task 1:-Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:- Classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of the 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9.
Task3:- Compare between various models and find the classifier that works better.

# About Dataset
Among thousands of datasets available in the market, MNIST is the most popular dataset for enthusiasts of machine learning and deep learning. Above 60,000 plus training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and more than 10,000 images for testing are present in the MNIST dataset. So, 10 different classes are in the MNIST dataset. The images of handwritten digits are shown as a matrix of 28Ã—28 where every cell consists of a grayscale pixel value.
